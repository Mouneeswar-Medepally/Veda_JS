/*
synchronous and asynchronous programming are two different ways of handling tasks,
especially those involving I/O operations such as network requests, file operations, or timers. 

Synchronous Programming
Synchronous programming means that tasks are performed one after another, in sequence. 
Each task must complete before the next one begins. This can lead to blocking behavior,
where long-running tasks can prevent subsequent tasks from executing.

Characteristics of Synchronous Programming:
Blocking: Subsequent tasks wait for the current task to complete.
Predictable: The order of execution is straightforward and predictable.

Drawback:
If a task takes a long time to complete (e.g., a complex computation or a slow network request),
it can block the entire program, making it unresponsive.


Example:
console.log('Task 1');
console.log('Task 2');
console.log('Task 3');
In this example, the tasks (console logs) execute one after another, in sequence.


Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed without blocking the main thread. Tasks can start, run in the background, and complete at a later time, allowing other tasks to continue in the meantime. 
This is essential for maintaining responsiveness in applications, especially those with I/O operations.

Characteristics of Asynchronous Programming:
Non-blocking: Tasks can run concurrently, allowing other tasks to execute without waiting.
Event-driven: Uses callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle the completion of asynchronous tasks.

Advantages of Asynchronous Programming:
Responsiveness: Keeps applications responsive by allowing other tasks to run while waiting for long-running operations to complete.
Concurrency: Handles multiple operations concurrently, improving efficiency.


Wait but JS is single-threaded language , how async tasks run?

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it has a single call stack that it uses to execute code. However, it can handle asynchronous tasks efficiently using the event loop and various APIs provided by the browser or Node.js. These mechanisms enable JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, allowing it to handle I/O tasks, timers, and other asynchronous activities without blocking the main thread.

How Asynchronous Tasks Work in a Single-Threaded Environment
1. The Call Stack
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls. It operates on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. When a function is called, it’s pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, it’s popped off the stack.

2. Web APIs (in Browsers) / Node APIs (in Node.js)
These APIs provide the ability to perform asynchronous operations. For example:

Web APIs: setTimeout, fetch, DOM events, etc.
Node.js APIs: fs.readFile, network requests, etc.
When an asynchronous operation is initiated (e.g., setTimeout), the task is handed off to the Web API or Node API, allowing the main thread to continue executing other code.

3. The Event Loop
The event loop is a mechanism that continuously checks the call stack and 
the task queue:

Call Stack: Executes JavaScript code.
Task Queue (or Callback Queue): Holds callbacks from asynchronous operations that are ready to be executed.
The event loop performs the following steps:

Check the Call Stack: If it’s not empty, it continues executing the code.
Check the Task Queue: If the call stack is empty and there are tasks in the task queue, the event loop pushes the first task from the queue onto the call stack for execution.
4. The Microtask Queue
In addition to the task queue, there's also a microtask queue, which has higher priority than the task queue. Microtasks include promises and other tasks that should be executed as soon as possible after the current operation completes.












Single-threaded languages, like JavaScript, execute code on a single thread. This means that all operations, whether computationally intensive tasks or I/O operations, are processed sequentially on one thread. Let's delve deeper into why this can lead to inefficiencies, especially in the context of multi-core processors and resource-heavy applications.

Understanding Multi-Core Processors
Multi-core processors are CPUs that have multiple processing units (cores) on a single chip. Each core can execute separate threads simultaneously. Modern computers often come with multiple cores, which can significantly enhance performance by allowing parallel processing of tasks.

Single-Threaded Execution
In a single-threaded environment, only one thread is active at any given time, regardless of how many cores are available. This can lead to several inefficiencies:

Limited Parallelism:

Underutilization of Cores: While one core is busy executing the single thread, the other cores remain idle. This results in underutilization of the CPU's full potential.
Sequential Processing: Tasks that could be executed in parallel are processed sequentially, leading to slower overall execution.
Blocking Operations:

CPU-bound Tasks: Intensive computations (e.g., data processing, mathematical calculations) can monopolize the single thread, blocking other operations and reducing responsiveness.
I/O-bound Tasks: Operations like reading files or making network requests can block the thread until completion, causing delays in executing subsequent tasks.
Inefficient Resource Management:

Inability to Scale: In resource-heavy applications, the single-threaded model does not scale well. Adding more CPU cores does not improve performance because the single thread cannot be distributed across multiple cores.
Increased Latency: High-demand applications may experience increased latency and reduced throughput because the single thread becomes a bottleneck.
Mitigating Inefficiencies
To address these inefficiencies, several strategies can be employed:

Asynchronous Programming:

Non-blocking I/O: Use asynchronous APIs (e.g., Promises, async/await in JavaScript) to handle I/O operations without blocking the main thread.
Event Loop: Leverage the event loop to handle concurrency. While the event loop is still single-threaded, it allows the main thread to process other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
Worker Threads:

Parallel Execution: In JavaScript (Node.js), use worker threads to offload CPU-intensive tasks to separate threads, enabling parallel execution and better utilization of multi-core processors.
Background Processing: Use background workers or services to handle long-running tasks outside the main thread.
External Services:

Microservices Architecture: Distribute the workload across multiple services, each running on different threads or even different machines, to improve scalability and performance.
Example Scenario
Consider a server handling multiple client requests for data processing and storage. In a single-threaded model:

Each request is processed sequentially.
If a request involves intensive data processing, it blocks the thread, causing delays for subsequent requests.
Even if the server has multiple CPU cores, only one core is used for processing.
By employing worker threads or distributing the workload across multiple services, the server can handle requests in parallel, utilizing multiple cores and improving performance and scalability.

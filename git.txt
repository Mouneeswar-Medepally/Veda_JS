### Git: Version Control System

**Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows 
multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with 
each other's work. 
It tracks changes in files and helps in coordinating work among team members. 

### GitHub: Hosting for Git Repositories

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. 
It allows developers to collaborate, share, and manage their code 
with features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools.

#### Key Features of GitHub:

1. **Repository Hosting:** Store and manage your Git repositories in the cloud.
2. **Collaborative Features:** Pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
3. **GitHub Pages:** Host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.
4. **Actions:** Automate workflows like CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Gists:** Share snippets or single files with others.

#### Key Concepts in Git:

1. **Repository (Repo):** A directory or storage space where your project resides. A Git repository tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files within it.

2. **Commit:** A snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository. Each commit has a unique ID (hash) and usually contains a message describing the changes.

3. **Branch:** A pointer to a specific commit. It represents an independent line of development. The `main` branch is the default branch when you create a repository.

4. **Merge:** The process of combining the changes from one branch into another. This is often done to integrate features into the `main` branch.

5. **Clone:** A copy of an existing repository, including all its history and branches.

6. **Pull:** The process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.

7. **Push:** Sending your committed changes to a remote repository.

8. **Remote:** A reference to a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or network (e.g., GitHub). 

### Basic Git Commands

#### 1. **Initialize a Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

#### 2. **Clone a Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   - Copies an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine.

#### 3. **Check Repository Status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area.

#### 4. **Add Files to Staging Area:**
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   ```
   - Adds the specified file(s) to the staging area. Use `git add .` to stage all changed files.

#### 5. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```
   - Records the changes in the repository with a message describing what was done.

#### 6. **View Commit History:**
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
   - Displays the history of commits in the repository.

#### 7. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch <branch-name>
   ```
   - Creates a new branch with the specified name.

#### 8. **Switch to a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   - Switches to the specified branch.

#### 9. **Merge a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```
   - Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

#### 10. **Push Changes to Remote Repository:**
    ```bash
    git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
    ```
    - Sends the committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository.

#### 11. **Pull Changes from Remote Repository:**
    ```bash
    git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>
    ```
    - Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

#### 12. **Delete a Branch:**
    ```bash
    git branch -d <branch-name>
    ```
    - Deletes the specified branch locally.

In Git, understanding the different states of files—local, unstaged, and staged—is crucial for managing your changes and committing them to the repository. Here’s a detailed explanation of each state:

### 1. **Local Environment**

**Local Environment** refers to the working directory and 
the staging area on your local machine where you make changes to files. 

- **Working Directory:** This is where you have the actual files of your project on your local machine. You can edit, add, or delete files in this directory.

- **Staging Area (Index):** This is an intermediate area where Git tracks 
changes before committing them. When you use `git add`, 
you're moving changes from the working directory to the staging area. 

### 2. **Unstaged Changes**

**Unstaged Changes** are modifications to files in your working directory 
that have not yet been added to the staging area. 
These changes are visible in the working directory 
but are not yet marked for inclusion in the next commit.

- **How to Identify Unstaged Changes:**
  - Run `git status` to see which files have been modified but not staged.
  - Run `git diff` to see the actual changes in your files that are not yet staged.

- **Commands to Handle Unstaged Changes:**
  - **To see changes in files:**
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```
  - **To add unstaged changes to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    ```
  - **To discard changes in a file (reset to the last committed state):**
    ```bash
    git checkout -- <file-name>
    ```

### 3. **Staged Changes**

**Staged Changes** are modifications that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be committed. Staging allows you to prepare a snapshot of your changes before finalizing them with a commit.

- **How to Identify Staged Changes:**
  - Run `git status` to see which files are staged for the next commit.
  - Run `git diff --cached` to see the changes that have been staged but not yet committed.

- **Commands to Handle Staged Changes:**
  - **To stage changes:**
    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    ```
  - **To unstage changes (remove from staging area but keep in working directory):**
    ```bash
    git reset <file-name>
    ```
  - **To commit staged changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    ```

### Summary of States

1. **Local Environment:** Refers to your working directory and staging area where you make and prepare changes.
2. **Unstaged Changes:** Modifications in your working directory that haven’t been added to the staging area yet.
3. **Staged Changes:** Modifications that have been added to the staging area and are ready to be included in the next commit.


### Basic GitHub Commands (using Git)

#### 1. **Create a Remote Repository:**
   - You can create a repository on GitHub from their website. After creating, you’ll get a URL to push your local repository to GitHub.

#### 2. **Add a Remote Repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```
   - Links your local repository to the remote GitHub repository.

#### 3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```
   - Pushes your branch to the GitHub repository and sets `origin` as the default remote.

#### 4. **Fork a Repository:**
   - On GitHub, click the "Fork" button to create your copy of someone else’s repository.

#### 5. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - After pushing your changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request on GitHub to suggest changes to the original project.

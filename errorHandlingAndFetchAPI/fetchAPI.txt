The Fetch API is a modern interface for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. 
It's a cleaner, more powerful alternative to the older XMLHttpRequest. 

fetch(url, options)
    .then(response => {
        // handle response
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // handle error
    });


### Terminologies

### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

**HTTP** is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and 
information on the internet. 
It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

**Key Features of HTTP:**

1. **Stateless Protocol:** Each request from a client to a server is independent; the server does not retain any information about previous requests.
2. **Request-Response Model:** HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. The client sends a request, and the server responds with the requested resource.
3. **URL:** Resources are identified and located on the web using URLs 
(Uniform Resource Locators).
4. **Methods:** The main HTTP methods are:
   - **GET:** Requests data from a specified resource.
   - **POST:** Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
   - **PUT:** Updates a current resource with new data.
   - **DELETE:** Deletes the specified resource.
5. **Unencrypted:** Data transferred using HTTP is not encrypted, 
meaning it can be intercepted and read by anyone 
with access to the data transmission.

### HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)

**HTTPS** is an extension of HTTP. It uses encryption to secure data transferred between a client and a server. HTTPS is essentially HTTP layered over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security).

**Key Features of HTTPS:**

1. **Encryption:** Data is encrypted, making it secure and unreadable to anyone 
intercepting the transmission. 
This is crucial for protecting sensitive information such as login credentials, 
credit card numbers, and personal data.
2. **Authentication:** HTTPS ensures that the client is communicating with the 
intended server and not an imposter. 
This is achieved through SSL/TLS certificates issued by trusted Certificate 
Authorities (CAs).
3. **Data Integrity:** HTTPS ensures that the data sent and received 
has not been tampered with during transmission.
4. **SSL/TLS Handshake:** When a client connects to a server over HTTPS, 
an SSL/TLS handshake occurs, establishing a secure connection 
before data transfer begins.
5. **Port 443:** HTTPS typically uses port 443, 
whereas HTTP uses port 80.

**Comparison between HTTP and HTTPS:**

- **Security:** HTTP is not secure, while HTTPS is secure due to encryption.
- **Performance:** HTTPS can be slightly slower than HTTP 
due to the overhead of encryption and decryption processes.
- **SEO:** Search engines like Google give preference to HTTPS sites, 
positively affecting their ranking.
- **Trust:** Websites using HTTPS are generally perceived as more trustworthy by users.

In summary, while HTTP is suitable for general data transfer on the web, HTTPS is essential for secure communication, particularly when dealing with sensitive information.


#### 1. **URL**
The URL specifies the endpoint to which the request is made.

#### 2. **Options Object**
An optional object that configures the fetch request. It can include:

- **method**: Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE').
- **headers**: An object containing any HTTP headers to include in the request.
- **body**: The data to send with the request, usually in a POST or PUT request.
- **mode**: Determines the mode of the request (e.g., 'cors', 'no-cors', 'same-origin').
- **credentials**: Controls whether cookies are sent with the request ('omit', 'same-origin', 'include').
- **cache**: Specifies the caching mode (e.g., 'default', 'no-store', 'reload').
- **redirect**: Controls the behavior of redirects (e.g., 'follow', 'manual', 'error').
- **referrer**: The referrer of the request.
- **integrity**: Subresource integrity value for the request.

#### 3. **Headers**
HTTP headers are key-value pairs that are included in the request or response. They provide information about the request/response such as content type, authorization tokens, and more.

- **Request Headers**: Headers sent from the client to the server.
- **Response Headers**: Headers sent from the server back to the client.

Example of setting headers:

```javascript
headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token'
}
```

#### 4. **Response**
The Response object represents the response to a request. It contains information such as the status code, status message, headers, and the body.

Key properties and methods of the Response object:

- **ok**: Boolean indicating whether the response was successful (status in the range 200-299).
- **status**: The HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404).
- **statusText**: The status message corresponding to the status code.
- **headers**: A Headers object containing the response headers.
- **json()**: Parses the response body as JSON.
- **text()**: Parses the response body as text.
- **blob()**: Parses the response body as a Blob.
- **arrayBuffer()**: Parses the response body as an ArrayBuffer.
- **formData()**: Parses the response body as FormData.

Example of using the Response object:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok ' + response.statusText);
        }
        return response.json(); // Parse the JSON response
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
    });
```

#### 5. **Promise**
The Fetch API is built on Promises, which represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

- **then()**: Attaches callbacks for the resolution and/or rejection of the Promise.
- **catch()**: Attaches a callback for only the rejection of the Promise.
- **finally()**: Attaches a callback that will be called regardless of the Promise's outcome.

Example:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
    });
```

#### 6. **AbortController**
AbortController is used to abort a fetch request. It provides an AbortSignal object which can be passed to the fetch request to signal cancellation.

Example:

```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

fetch('https://api.example.com/data', { signal })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
            console.log('Fetch aborted');
        } else {
            console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
        }
    });

// Abort the request
controller.abort();
```

### 1. **Request**

A request is an action initiated by a client (like a web browser or a mobile app) to a server to perform a specific operation. It consists of several parts:

#### Components of a Request:

- **HTTP Method**: Indicates the action to be performed. Common methods include:
  - `GET`: Retrieve data from the server.
  - `POST`: Submit data to the server.
  - `PUT`: Update data on the server.
  - `DELETE`: Delete data from the server.
  - `PATCH`: Partially update data on the server.

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: Specifies the location of the resource on the server. It includes the protocol (http or https), the domain, and the path to the resource.

- **Headers**: Metadata sent with the request, providing information like content type, authorization, etc.

- **Body**: Data sent with the request, typically with `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` requests. The body contains the data being submitted to the server.

Example of a request in JavaScript using the Fetch API:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer token'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' })
});
```

### 2. **Headers**

Headers are key-value pairs included in both requests and responses. They provide essential information about the request or response, such as the type of content being sent, authorization details, and more.

#### Common Request Headers:

- **Accept**: Specifies the content types that the client can handle. For example, `Accept: application/json` indicates that the client expects JSON data.
- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the request body. For example, `Content-Type: application/json` signifies that the request body is JSON data.
- **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating the request. For example, `Authorization: Bearer <token>` is used for token-based authentication.
- **User-Agent**: Provides information about the client software making the request.

#### Common Response Headers:

- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the response body.
- **Content-Length**: Specifies the size of the response body in bytes.
- **Set-Cookie**: Sets cookies that the client should store.
- **Cache-Control**: Specifies caching directives for the response.

Example of setting headers in a request:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer token'
    }
});
```

### 3. **Response**

A response is the server's reply to a client's request. It contains status information, headers, and possibly a body with the data requested.

#### Components of a Response:

- **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).

- **Headers**: Metadata about the response, similar to request headers.

- **Body**: The actual data sent back by the server, such as HTML, JSON, XML, or binary data.

Example of handling a response:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok ' + response.statusText);
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error);
    });
```

### 4. **HTTP Status Codes**

Status codes are three-digit numbers in the response that indicate the result of the request. They are grouped into five categories:

#### 1xx: Informational
- **100 Continue**: Indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and the client should continue.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: Indicates that the server is switching protocols as requested by the client.

#### 2xx: Success
- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a resource was created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to send back.

#### 3xx: Redirection
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: The resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request.

#### 4xx: Client Error
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.
- **403 Forbidden**: The client does not have access rights to the content.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used.

#### 5xx: Server Error
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to being overloaded or down for maintenance.

### Summary

Understanding these key terminologies—request, headers, response, and HTTP status codes—is crucial for working with APIs. Requests and responses form the core of client-server communication, headers provide essential metadata, and status codes inform the client about the result of the request. By grasping these concepts, you can effectively interact with APIs and troubleshoot issues that may arise.
